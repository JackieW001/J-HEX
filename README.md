## Description
J-HEX presents Clover, a financial manager where users will be able to input data about their finances, savings, and expenditures. The user will be able to see a history of their past spendings and set budgets for their future expenditures. Users will also be able to clearly see breakdowns of their expenditures and projected savings via graphs and charts generated by d3. Another feature of Clover is that users will be able to track and manage their stocks. They will be able to easily see the profit they make from their stocks via d3 charts and search up new stocks to add to their portfolio.
